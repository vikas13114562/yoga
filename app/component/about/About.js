          I'm Aishwarya Upadhyay, your dedicated yoga instructor. With few years
          of experience in the world of yoga, I have dedicated myself to the
          practice and teaching of this ancient art of traditional yoga.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began 2-years ago in Rishikesh When I had joined my first
          class the experience of Savasana and OM chanting provided me with
          profound relaxation and a sense of returning to my true self. This is
          when yoga become the beginning of a lifelong journey for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teaching style is deeply rooted in Pranayama, Meditation, Yin yoga,
          prenatal yoga and Ashtanga yog with anatomy. I love learning more and
          more about yoga, and I want to share all this amazing knowledge with
          everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The more I learn, the better I become at teaching it in a
          fun and exciting way. Itâ€™s truly an honour to take this incredible
          journey with my students and I'm passionate about helping students
          discover the physical, mental, and spiritual benefits of yoga."
