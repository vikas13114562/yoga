          "It can feel extremely wonderful to exercise a Yin Yoga sequence to aid in your transition into deep relaxation after a hard day at work, sitting at a desk, and not moving around much.\nIn normal yoga, we emphasize body) and formlessness (breathe, energy channels, and mind states). But to lubricate and protect our joints, yin yoga targets the connective tissues, fascia, and ligaments by providing deeper access to the body. The majority of the poses in yin yoga are performed while seated or lying on the floor, which makes it a very passive form of yoga. The poses are held for a longer period of time, generally for three to five minutes and even reach upto twenty minutes.\nYin yoga teaches us how to examine and let go of the accumulated emotions and trauma through releasing feelings and sensations that come in “sitting still” pose for an extended period of time. This method is more meditative than conventional hatha yoga practices.\nThe ideal yoga style to begin your journey is yin yoga. It aids in strengthening deeper tissues, increases muscle flexibility and lengthens the muscles, both of which are beneficial for performing the advanced asanas.",

            "For those who suffer with ailments or injuries, yin yoga is perfect. It progressively improves yoga practice and meditation by softening muscles, releasing deep layers of connective tissues and gently extending joint range of motion.",
            "Yin yoga is intended to increase flexibility and mobility, so a beginner with stiff joints should learn yin yoga first to reduce the stiffness. Those who are interested in meditation and wish to learn more about it could take benefit from yin yoga.",
            "For someone who wishes to progressively go into the rich depths of yoga, yin yoga is an excellent way to start. Beginners find it simpler to learn sequences than they would learn in a quick vinyasa yoga practice since yin yoga is a slower practice with asanas held for a longer period of time.",
            "Yin yoga also clears obstructions from the body's major energy meridians, which promotes optimal physical wellness. It improves the movement of our body’s prana, or life force, particularly around the tissues and joints which frequently stagnate. It reinforces the energy channels, which enhances support for the organs and immune system.",
            "Yin yoga is for those who become disoriented by even little changes in their everyday routine. The prolonged holding of poses teach them how to tolerate discomfort and become aware of strong sensations that arise. This may involve accepting the small annoyances that may cause stress in daily life.",

            "Since yin yoga does not include strenuous physical exertion, it is not necessary to have a heated environment or a strong physique. The yin yoga poses are relatively easy to accomplish and may be practiced anywhere, any time.",
            "The fundamental need is that one should perform the yin yoga sequence for a longer period of time. Initially hold it for a minute, and with frequent practice, holding may reach upto five minutes at once.",
            "The yin yoga postures are mostly seated positions that put the practitioner at ease and in a calm state. Examples include butterfly pose, frog pose, forward fold pose and many more. Make sure to maintain that posture without moving. Moving around needlessly and expending all of your energy on holding your pose will be of no use.",
            "Never forget that we don't have to make this experience painful. Use your body as much as possible, and savour the sensation of “pleasant discomfort.” Additionally, because breathing is crucial in determining the flow of energy in the body, be sure that the breathing is even and continuous rather than irregular round inhales and exhales.",

Thoughts are good, but it’s best to pay attention to your body’s breathing sensations and the area where you feel the stretch strongly. Your muscles will start to relax a little more if you focus your breathing on that area. Instead of thinking of yin yoga as “stretching”, think of “releasing tension” in the muscle will be more beneficial because this better captures the passive aspect of the practice.",
